# Simple-Calculator-GUI
This is a calculator with a GUI that performs simple arithmetic. Users click buttons on the GUI to insert operands and operators.  

To run this application, first use a Java compiler to compile all the Java class files with the .java filename extension. The version of Java I used to develop this application is 1.8, but slightly older versions should work as well. Then execute the Java class file for the SimpleCalculator class, which contains the main method.
